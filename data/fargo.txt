We’ve had to wait a while for the third series of Fargo – but the good news is that the next helping of the cult show is finally on its way. Makers FX have confirmed that the next season – starring Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Carrie Coon and David Thewlis – will arrive on US screens on April 19. There’s no word yet on when we’ll get to see it here, but since Channel 4 – who have aired the first two seasons of the show – screened them around the same time as US viewers got to see them, we’re guessing we won’t have too long to wait. While we don’t yet know a whole lot about the actual storyline of Fargo round 3, we do know that this time the action is brought right forwards in time to 2010, and that it sees McGregor as brothers Emmit and Ray Stussy – the latter being resentful of his more successful brother. And based on previous series of the show, we’re guessing things don’t end too well for them.
